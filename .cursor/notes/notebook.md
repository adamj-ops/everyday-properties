# Notebook - Everyday Properties Development

## Key Findings and Insights

### Database Schema Analysis
The Prisma schema reveals a well-designed property management system with:
- **Multi-tenant architecture** using `orgId` across all models
- **Comprehensive property model** with address fields and notes
- **Flexible unit system** with status tracking and amenities JSON field
- **Advanced lease management** with participants and status tracking
- **Work order system** with priority and status management
- **Financial ledger** with charge types and credit tracking
- **Notification system** with multiple channels and status tracking

### Current System State (September 6, 2025)
- **Framework**: Next.js with Turborepo monorepo structure
- **Status**: Phase 0 incomplete - environment setup required
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma (relationMode="prisma")
- **Authentication**: Clerk integration planned but not configured
- **UI**: shadcn/ui design system with custom components already built

### Technical Debt Identified
1. **Missing Indexes**: Prisma warnings indicate missing indexes for relation fields
2. **Environment Setup**: No environment variables configured
3. **RLS Policies**: Row Level Security policies need implementation
4. **Test Scripts**: Phase 0 test script exists but environment prevents execution

### Architecture Strengths
- **Monorepo Structure**: Well-organized with clear separation of concerns
- **Design System**: Comprehensive UI components already built
- **Database Design**: Proper normalization and relationships
- **Multi-tenancy**: Built-in from the ground up

### Key Components Already Available
- Dashboard with KPI cards (`packages/design-system/components/dashboard/dashboard.tsx`)
- Properties page component (`packages/design-system/components/properties/properties-page.tsx`)
- Sidebar navigation (`packages/design-system/components/layout/sidebar.tsx`)
- Database seeding script with test data (`packages/database/scripts/seed.ts`)

### Environment Requirements
Based on the Phase 0 test script and Prisma schema:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - Clerk authentication secret
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Clerk public key

### Development Strategy Insights
1. **Phase 0 is Critical**: All environment setup must be completed first
2. **Component Reuse**: Many UI components are already built and can be leveraged
3. **Database First**: Schema is well-designed, focus on connecting and seeding
4. **Incremental Testing**: Each feature should be tested immediately after implementation

### Next Immediate Actions
1. Complete environment setup (DATABASE_URL, Clerk keys)
2. Run database migrations and seeding
3. Verify Phase 0 tests pass
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation using existing components

## Useful Code Patterns Discovered

### Multi-tenant Data Access Pattern
```typescript
// All database queries should include orgId filter
const properties = await db.property.findMany({
  where: { orgId: user.orgId },
  include: { units: true }
});
```

### Role-based Access Control Pattern
```typescript
// UserProfile model includes role field
role: String // admin, manager, leasing, maintenance, resident
```

### Status Enum Usage
```typescript
// Multiple status enums for different entities
enum UnitStatus { vacant, occupied, make_ready, maintenance_hold }
enum LeaseStatus { draft, active, pending, terminated, renewed }
enum WoStatus { open, in_progress, completed, cancelled }
```

## Questions for Future Investigation
1. How should we handle file uploads for lease documents and work order photos?
2. What payment processing integration is planned?
3. Should we implement real-time notifications?
4. How will the resident portal be integrated?

## Performance Considerations
- Add indexes for frequently queried relation fields
- Consider pagination for large property/unit lists
- Implement proper caching strategy for dashboard metrics
- Optimize database queries with proper includes/selects
